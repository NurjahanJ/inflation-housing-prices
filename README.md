Inflation and Housing Prices in the U.S. (2014-2024)

Essential Question

How has inflation impacted housing prices in different U.S. cities over the past decade?

Data Sources

To analyze the relationship between inflation and housing prices, we are using the following datasets:

Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index (HPI)

Dataset Link

Measures changes in housing prices across the U.S., helping us track how home values have evolved over time.

U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI-U)

West Region CPI Data

Provides inflation data for different metropolitan areas, showing how the cost of living has changed.

City-specific CPI datasets:

Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA

San Diego-Carlsbad, CA

San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA

Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA

Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ

Freddie Mac House Price Index (FMHPI)

Dataset Link

Another measure of home price changes that complements the FHFA HPI data.

How These Datasets Answer the Question

CPI Data shows how inflation has fluctuated in different cities, giving us insight into cost-of-living increases.

HPI and FMHPI Data track housing price changes, revealing how much home values have increased over time.

By comparing inflation rates with housing price growth, we can determine whether housing prices have outpaced inflation and assess affordability trends.

Initial Thoughts on Visualization Approaches

To effectively communicate insights from the data, we plan to create the following visualizations:
