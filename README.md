# Inflation and Housing Prices in the U.S. (2014-2024)

## Essential Question

How has inflation impacted housing prices in different U.S. cities over the past decade?

## Data Sources

To analyze the relationship between inflation and housing prices, I am using the following datasets:

1. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index (HPI):

* [Dataset Link]: https://www.fhfa.gov/data/hpi/datasets?utm_source=chatgpt.com

* Measures changes in housing prices across the U.S., helping us track how home values have evolved over time.

2. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI-U)

* [West Region CPI Data]: https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/factsheet/consumer-price-index-data-tables.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com

* Provides inflation data for different metropolitan areas, showing how the cost of living has changed.

* City-specific CPI datasets:
  * [Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA]: https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUURS49ASA0&output_view=pct_12mths#
  * [San Diego-Carlsbad, CA]: https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUURS49ESA0&output_view=pct_12mths
  * [San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA]: https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUURS49BSA0&output_view=pct_12mths
  * [Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA]: https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUURS49DSA0&output_view=pct_12mths
  * [Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ]: https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUURS48ASA0&output_view=pct_12mths

3. Freddie Mac House Price Index (FMHPI)

* Another measure of home price changes that complements the FHFA HPI data.

## How These Datasets Answer the Question

* CPI Data shows how inflation has fluctuated in different cities, giving us insight into cost-of-living increases.

* HPI and FMHPI Data track housing price changes, revealing how much home values have increased over time.
  
* By comparing inflation rates with housing price growth, we can determine whether housing prices have outpaced inflation and assess affordability trends.

## Initial Thoughts on Visualization Approaches

To effectively communicate insights from the data, we plan to create the following visualizations:

1. üìä Line Chart: Inflation vs. Housing Prices Over Time

   * Compares yearly changes in CPI and house prices to observe trends.

3. üìà Scatter Plot: Correlation Between Inflation & Housing Prices

   * Shows whether higher inflation is associated with rising housing prices.

3. üåç Heat Map: Cities Where Housing Prices Increased Most
  
   *Highlights the metropolitan areas that experienced the largest home price increases.

6. üìä Bar Chart: Comparing Inflation & House Prices by City
   
   * Displays side-by-side comparisons of CPI % change and housing price % change in different cities.
